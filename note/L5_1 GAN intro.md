## Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)  
## Network as Generator  
 * ex.: input [x,Simple Distribution z] -> Network(Generator) -> output [Complex Distribution y]  
 * z: we know its formulation, so we can sample from it.  

## Why Generator? Why distribution?  
 * Especially for the tasks needs "creativity".  
 * The same input has different outputs.
