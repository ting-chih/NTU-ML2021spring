## version 0  
  * Reward delay: actor has to sacrifice immediate reward to gain more long-term reward.  
  * in space invader, only "fire" can yield positive reward.  
  * when RL firstly acts "fire", then RL will always act "fire".  

## version 1  
  * cumulated reward, to make sure, the reward represents which acts.  

## version 2  
  * set a discount factor  
  * Discount factor can make new act has small weight because the previous acts are important.  

## version 3  
  * Good or Bad reward is "relative"  
  * we minus baseline b to make G have positive and negative values.  

## policy gradient
