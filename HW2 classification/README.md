## What is a phoneme?  

  * A unit of speech sound in a language that can serve to distinguish one word from the other  


* First run `model 1.ipynb`, `model 2.ipynb`, `model 3.ipynb`, respectively. These will generate models `modeldnn.ckpt`, `model2dnn.ckpt`, and `model3dnn.ckpt`.

* Then run `ensemble.ipynb`, this will ensemble the three models and the final predictions are save in `prediction_ensemble.csv`.
