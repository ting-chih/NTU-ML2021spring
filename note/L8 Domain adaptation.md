## Domain adaptation -> Transfer learning  
## Domain shift: Training and testing data have different distributions.  

  * Source domain: Training data(with labeled data)  
  * Target domain: Testing data  
  * Idea: training a model by source data, then fine-tune the model by target data  
  * Challenge: only limited target data, so be careful about overfitting  

## Basic idea
