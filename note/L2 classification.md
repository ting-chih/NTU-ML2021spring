the example about to spam filtering:  
  input: email  
  output: yes/no  

* and more(structured learning...)  

# How to find a function?  

## 1. function with unknown parameters
  * y = f(x) = b + w*x1 (based on domain knowledge)
  * w and b are unknown parameters(learning from data)  
  * Model = y
  * feature = x1
  * weight = w
  * bias = b
